# MIT Break Through Tech Project

## Overview

This project is part of the MIT Break Through Tech initiative. The project includes an analysis of census data using Python, specifically through a Jupyter Notebook. The key files in this project include a Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and a CSV file containing census data.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- **Lab8.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis for the project. This notebook includes data loading, processing, and analysis using the `censusData.csv` file.
- **censusData.csv**: A CSV file containing the raw census data used in the analysis. This data is loaded into the Jupyter Notebook for processing and analysis.
- **README.md**: The file you are currently reading, which provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage details.

## Prerequisites

To run the code in this project, you'll need the following software installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas library (for data manipulation)

You can install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the Repository: If you haven't already, clone this repository to your local machine.
```bash
git clone <https://github.com/sherrenjie/MIT-Break-Through-Tech-Project>
```

2. Navigate to the Project Directory: Change your working directory to the project's directory.
```bash
cd MIT-Break-Through-Tech-Project-main
```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook: Start Jupyter Notebook and open the Lab8.ipynb file.
```
bash
jupyter notebook Lab8.ipynb
```

4. Run the Notebook: Execute the cells in the notebook to perform the data analysis. The notebook contains step-by-step instructions and explanations for each part of the analysis.

## Data
The `censusData.csv` file contains raw census data, which is used in the Jupyter Notebook for various analyses. The dataset includes information such as population demographics, employment statistics, and more.

## Usage
This project is designed to provide insights into census data through a series of Python-based analyses. The Jupyter Notebook guides you through the process of data loading, cleaning, and analysis, providing a hands-on approach to working with real-world data.
